## Formatting Details

### Currency Formatting
- All monetary values use US Dollar format
- No decimal places for whole dollar amounts
- Example: $15,000,000

### Percentage Formatting
- Positive percentages show "+" prefix
- Negative percentages show "-" prefix
- One decimal place precision
- Example: +11.1%, -5.3%

### Conditional Formatting
- Percentage changes â‰¥10% are highlighted in red
- High-risk indicators for significant changes
- Visual emphasis on driving peril data

### Table Styling
- Professional borders and shading
- Clear column headers
- Alternating row colors for readability
- Bold formatting for section headers

## File Naming Convention

Files are named using the pattern: `Notes_[YYYYMMDD].xlsx`

Examples:
- `Notes_20250708.xlsx` (July 8, 2025)
- `Notes_20241215.xlsx` (December 15, 2024)

## Data Aggregation Rules

### Multiple Database Handling
- AAL values are summed across databases
- TIV values are summed across databases
- EP curves are averaged across databases
- Database versions are listed for each database

### Percentage Calculations
- AAL % Change: `(Current - Previous) / Previous * 100`
- TIV % Change: `(Current - Previous) / Previous * 100`
- Company vs Broker: `(Company - Broker) / Broker * 100`

### Driving Peril Logic
- Peril with highest aggregated AAL is identified as driving peril
- Used for focus in Notes sheet
- Primary metric for analysis summary

## Error Handling

### Missing Data
- Previous year data: Shows "N/A" in Previous Year columns
- Broker data: Omits broker comparison sections
- Single database: Generates report with current year only

### Invalid Data
- Graceful handling of API errors
- Clear error messages in Notes sheet
- Fallback to available data

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data in file names
- Timestamp-based naming for uniqueness
- Client-side generation for privacy

### SharePoint Integration
- Uses SharePoint authentication
- Secure API token handling
- Azure AD integration for API access
